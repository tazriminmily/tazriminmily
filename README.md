# 😊 Hi there! I'm **Tazrimin Rahman Mily**

I'm a curious and passionate software developer who loves bringing ideas to life with clean code, thoughtful architecture, and a touch of creativity. With over **4 years of professional experience** in the .NET ecosystem, I’ve had the pleasure of building applications that solve real-world problems — from designing secure, scalable APIs to delivering dynamic frontends and deploying cloud-native solutions.

I thrive on learning, adapting, and pushing my boundaries. Whether it's backend logic, frontend design, or cloud engineering — I find joy in connecting all the dots that turn ideas into impactful products. I’ve also worked with **bank synchronization systems**, integrating financial data using the **Plaid API** and managing **webhook-driven data updates** to ensure secure and seamless connectivity.

## 🔧 Tech I Enjoy Working With

### 💻 Languages

I feel right at home writing in:

* **C#** – My go-to for backend development and building APIs with ASP.NET Core
* **JavaScript** – For adding interactivity and structure to web apps, primarily with Angular
* **SQL** – For crafting powerful queries and designing relational data models

### ⚙️ Frameworks & Libraries

Tools I use to turn code into cohesive, performant applications:

* **ASP.NET Core** – For robust, scalable APIs and full-stack web development
* **Entity Framework Core** – For efficient data access and code-first database management
* **Angular** – For building responsive, user-friendly frontends

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure

I’m fascinated by the cloud and the possibilities it unlocks:

* **Microsoft Azure** – My current favorite for deploying services, serverless apps, and storage solutions
* **AWS** – Where I’m building deeper knowledge around services like Lambda and S3
* **Docker** – For containerizing applications and ensuring consistency across environments

### 📊 Databases

I enjoy working with:

* **SQL Server** – For most of my enterprise-level projects
* **PostgreSQL** – For open-source and cloud-based systems
* **Oracle** – Gaining hands-on experience with larger, enterprise data environments

### 🛠️ Tools I Use Regularly

* **Visual Studio** – My trusted IDE for all things .NET
* **Git** – For version control and collaborating efficiently
* **Docker** – To simplify deployment and testing
* **VS Code** – For quick edits, scripting, and cross-platform projects

## 🚀 What I’m Up To

Here’s a snapshot of what I’ve been focused on lately:

* **🔗 Designing APIs:**
  Building secure, modular, and scalable APIs is something I’m passionate about. I carefully consider architecture, data flow, and performance when designing backend services.

* **🔒 Security First:**
  I strongly believe that good security should be baked in from the start. I implement industry-standard practices using JWT tokens, API keys, IP whitelisting, domain-level restrictions, and **IdentityServer** to ensure applications are protected without compromising usability.

* **🌍 Speaking Many Languages:**
  I build applications that speak to users around the globe. By localizing APIs and user interfaces, I ensure accessibility and usability for diverse audiences — tech that connects people regardless of language or location.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

As a lifelong learner, I'm always working on growing both my technical and theoretical knowledge. Right now, I'm focused on:

* **🏗️ System Design:**
  I’m diving deep into scalable architecture like clean code principles, onion architecture, microservices, and distributed systems. I love studying how large systems are designed to be fault-tolerant, loosely coupled, and resilient.

* **☁️ Cloud Development:**
  Cloud-native development is a key area of growth for me. I’m exploring serverless architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and best practices for deploying resilient, globally available apps with Azure and AWS.

* **🎓 PhD Aspirations:**
  Alongside my professional journey, I’m also exploring research opportunities in **software engineering** — with an eye on **PhD programs in Germany or other countries**. I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between academic research and practical development challenges in cloud architecture and system design.

## 💡 Fun Fact & Background

I didn’t start in software — my academic journey began with a **Master’s degree in Pure Physics**. I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and physics gave me a rigorous, analytical way of thinking. But it was my curiosity about technology and the joy I found in building things that led me to software development.

Since then, I’ve never looked back.

What I love most about tech is that every day presents a new opportunity to learn something, solve a problem, or create something meaningful. Whether I’m writing an API, optimizing a query, or learning about a new Azure service, it always feels like an adventure.
