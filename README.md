## 💼 Professional Summary

With a focus on backend development and cloud-based systems, I’ve spent the last few years crafting reliable, efficient, and user-focused software using the .NET ecosystem. Whether it’s architecting RESTful APIs, implementing secure authentication flows, or building responsive frontends with Angular, I enjoy working across the full stack to bring ideas to life.

What drives me is the challenge of solving real-world problems with clean code, thoughtful design, and scalable architecture. I'm also passionate about improving the developer experience through automation, good practices, and continuous learning.
