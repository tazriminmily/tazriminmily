# 😊 Hi there! I'm **Tazrimin Rahman Mily**

I'm a software developer who finds joy in turning ideas into real, working software. I’ve spent the last more than 4 years in the .NET world, where I’ve helped design and build systems that do more than just function — they make a difference. Whether it’s shaping the backend of a feature-rich application or bringing clarity to frontend behavior, I enjoy the mix of logic and creativity that comes with every new challenge.

What drew me to tech is the thrill of solving problems. I’m naturally curious, and I love understanding how things work — especially when I can build or improve them. Writing clean, thoughtful code is my way of shaping solutions that are as reliable as they are maintainable.

## 💼 Professional Experience

Here’s a closer look at the types of systems I’ve been part of and the problems I’ve helped solve:

* **ERP Systems**: I’ve had the chance to work deeply on core ERP modules like **Human Resource Management (HRM)**, **Supply Chain Management (SCM)**, and **Payroll**. These weren’t just about input screens and reports — I worked on systems that directly improved how teams hired, managed inventories, and ran payroll efficiently.

* **Banking Systems**: My role in financial software included features like **account management**, **transaction processing**, and **real-time data updates** using APIs such as **Plaid**. I’ve also developed and maintained **webhook** solutions to ensure seamless communication between financial services in real-time.

* **Workflow Automation**: One of my favorite areas — designing automated workflows for approvals, data flows, and task handoffs. It’s amazing how much time and effort you can save by replacing manual steps with well-thought-out automation.

* **Accounting & Finance Integrations**: I’ve built integrations with **QuickBooks** and internal systems to handle everything from **invoices**, **vouchers**, and **transactions** to **statements**. This work helped clients maintain accuracy and gain visibility over their financial activities.

Each project has pushed me to think critically, understand user pain points, and build solutions that feel intuitive and dependable.

## 🚀 What I’m Up To

Lately, I’ve been focused on:

* **🔗 Designing APIs** – I take pride in crafting APIs that are clean, well-documented, and built to scale.
* **🔒 Security by Design** – From token-based auth (JWT) to full IdentityServer implementations, security is always a priority.
* **🌍 Localization** – Making applications accessible to a global user base through localization and internationalization.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

Because tech never stops evolving, I’m continuously learning:

* **🏗️ System Design** – Microservices, message queues, fault tolerance — it’s about designing for the future.
* **☁️ Cloud Development** – Deep diving into cloud-native approaches with Azure and AWS.
* **🎓 PhD Goals** – I’m exploring software engineering research topics, especially around distributed systems, with a goal to pursue a **PhD in Germany**.

## 💡 A Bit of Backstory

My academic journey began in **Pure Physics** — drawn by curiosity about how the universe works. Over time, that curiosity turned toward how software systems work, and I made the transition into tech. It’s been one of the most rewarding decisions of my life.

Every project I take on is a chance to learn something new and deliver something valuable. Whether it's smoothing out an API response or building a feature from scratch, I enjoy the details as much as the big picture.
